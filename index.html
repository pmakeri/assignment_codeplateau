                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    My name is Peter Makeri Azi, a graduate of Computer Science University of Jos, I'm from 
                    Jos East Plateau. I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself,
                    so I have something to strive toward (Software Engineering). I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always
                    looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.

                            Outside Code Plateau, I do some businesses like Youtubing, Social Media Marking, Graphics Design farming as well.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            So far my experience in Code Plateau is being awesome; I’ve developed a way to learn and interact with others that has helped me to work with my fellow student as a team. I have come to believe that Code Plateau will help me to develop into a better programmer and an altruistic  as well, one that has the zeal to put others first. I consider the act of learning a two way avenue that has to be taken seriously. It is one that involves the teacher, and the protégé. It has been, and will continue to be, my absolute goal as a student to become a diligent protégé and acquire all of learning my teachers/Instructor has set in front of me.
